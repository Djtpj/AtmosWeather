## The lightweight app for weather forecasts and alerts.
(This app was originally created for the 2022 Congressional App Challenge.)

# Planned Features

### Mobile and Desktop Platforms
Atmos Weather is available on both Windows and Android.
Unlike most weather apps, Atmos provides weather alerts to users on desktop.

### Total Control
Atmos Weather allows you to choose multiple locations to receive warnings from.
In settings, you can control what priority the notifications are and choose which types of warnings to recieve audible alerts for.

### More Information
Atmos Weather gives you more information about weather warnings.
Instead of a text-based warning, Atmos generates a map of warning polygons.

### No Bloat
Atmos Weather does not contain ads because it uses free services and volunteers (making the cost to run $0.)

### Reliable Data
Atmos Weather uses the official National Weather Service API to provide the most accurate warnings possible.

# Installation

The easiest way to install Atmos Weather is by using the website: [Atmos Weather Website](https://atticuscornett.github.io/atmos-weather).
You can also install from the build folders located in each platform's folder.
